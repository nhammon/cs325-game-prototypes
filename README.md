# GMU CS325 Introduction to Game Design

This repository will contain links and source for all of your games.
This repository should be marked as GitHub Pages. This lets you run your games directly from GitHub!
Check it out: [http://nhammon.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/](https://nhammon.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/)
Fork this repository and start making your own games!

You can't run the `index.html` for your games directly from your local machine without a local webserver.
If you try, many things won't load (your browser will think it's malicious).
To get around this, if you have Python, simply enter the directory and
type `python3 -m http.server`.
If you have [`node.js`](http://nodejs.org/), you can easily install (`npm install http-server -g`);
then enter the directory and run a local HTTP server (`http-server`).
Once you have your local server running, browse to it using Chrome:
most likely [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) or [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
